# Object Oriented Programing in python

- Class : We can create a class in python just by useing class keyword, and  the name of the class must be in First letter Capitalize. To creat attributes in that class we can use a def or defination or a function named as __init__ with parameters which we can use as a attribute for the class, we also need a self parameter first to signify that which attribute are include inside the class. __init__ is basically a constructor which helps to create a new instance of the class. self keyword is used to link or create a connection between the class atributes and the instance of that variable to communicate with the attributes.

- Inheritance - Inheritance means you can access all attribute from another class and the class which can access the attribute is actually a instance of that class with full access in their attribute or inherit from that class. if we use super() it accually helps to access the class attribute from where it inherit.
