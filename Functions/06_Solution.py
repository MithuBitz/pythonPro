# Lambda Function

# Lambda function or anonymous function are used in situation where you need a small and throwaway funcion or so to say single time use funcion 

cube = lambda x: x ** 3

print(cube(3))

# anotherCube = cube() ## We cannot use like this bcoz lamda function hold inside a variable cube so it is one time use.
