# Function in Python

> *arg - arg in python helps to get multiple arguments by declare only *arg in the paramete of the function. We can write anything in place of arg but its a good and best practice to write as a "arg". multiple arguments or arg or so to say parameters are store as a tuple inside the memory, so we can also iterate through its item to do many function or calculation. 

> *kwargs - kwargs or key value args helps to enter parameter in key value format. 

> yeild - yeild is a replacement of return in a function. yeild helps to keep tracks on function state if it is execute earlier and also keeps track of the value yeild by the funcion.
